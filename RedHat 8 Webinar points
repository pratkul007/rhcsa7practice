The things that are same in previous and RHEL 8 

 - Enterprise OS on all footprints (i.e whether its on physical machine or on VM or on cloud. It should operate similar on all paltform)

 - Development process will be same i.e first testing gets perfomed on Fedora and then on redhat

 - It can be managed by RedHat Satellite 


What is the Different 

 - Starting from redhat 8 there will be regular release cadence

 - more frequent application updates



Redhat is trying to make the process easy of migrating from one major release to other.
 - changes to anaconda, improvement in framework for in-place upgrade.


Next-Gen container tools

 - buildah
 - Skopeo
 - podman


In RHEL 8, Yum 4 is based on dnftechnology which makes faster dependencies resolution.


Improvements in Networking Services 

 - New TCP/IP stack
 - Improvements in NetworkManager


Storage 

 - Stratis - easy to use CLI for storage management

 - faster snapsho-like support, faster f.s checks


Some Questions asked by people

 - Will the AppStream releases be on the same cycle as the BaseOS.
   Ans - The first thing to understand is that RHEL 8 is composed of BaseOS, the kernel, system tools, resource management, etc. and the AppStreams, which is the userspace components


 - Can we perform in-place migrate to RHEL8 from REHL7 or RHEL6 ?
   Ans - The current plans are to support in-place upgrade with the tooling from RHEL 7 to RHEL 8. The Migration assessment tool can be run on RHEL 6 to provide you with a dashboard view of the differences from RHEL 6 to RHEL 8 so that you can plan. We also plan to update the migration guide to help you migrate from RHEL 6 to RHEL 8.
